## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to detect fake news from a given news corpus. This solution can be used by media companies to automatically classify news articles as real or fake, reducing the need for manual review.

### Features
- Import and visualize datasets with Python libraries.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and plot word-clouds.
- Clean text data by removing punctuation and stop words.
- Tokenize and pad text corpus for deep learning models.
- Train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM.
- Evaluate model performance.
